Convert your previous HTML+CSS project to Bootstrap by replacing custom CSS with Bootstrap’s built-in classes. Each team member will work individually on their own version of the web page, applying their assigned team’s Bootstrap topic.

Post a PDF screenshot of your completed Bootstrap webpage and a link to your GitHub repository containing your code.

You will also deploy your Bootstrap version on the VM.

Use Bootstrap classes and custom Bootstrap components to style your page.
Use manual CSS overrides (only where Bootstrap does not provide a built-in class).
- Apply the specific Bootstrap topic assigned to your team (see list below).
- remains responsive using Bootstrap’s layout system.
